# Neural-Network-Implementation-with-PyTorch

This repository contains the implementation of a basic Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using both manual tensor operations and PyTorch’s built-in functions.

## 🧐 Project Overview

The goal of this projecy is to manually implement a single hidden layer neural network and then replicate the same using PyTorch's built-in neural network functionalities. Below is a visual representation of the neural network used in this project:

### ✔️ Objectives:

* Implement forward propagation manually using tensors
* Calculate Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss
* Perform manual backpropagation using PyTorch's `autograd`
* Update weights using gradient descent
* Re-implement the same architecture using `torch.nn` and `torch.optim`

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* PyTorch
* Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Results

Both manual and PyTorch-based implementations achieve very low error with predictions close to the expected output:

```
Final Error (Manual): 1.6677285e-12  
Predicted Output: [[0.01000133, 0.98999876]]

Final Error (PyTorch): 2.3393960379980427e-13  
Predicted Output: [[0.01000054, 0.9899996]]
```
