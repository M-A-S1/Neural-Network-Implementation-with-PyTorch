# Neural-Network-Implementation-with-PyTorch
This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple feedforward neural network using basic tensor operations and PyTorch's built-in functions. The goal is to showcase the forward and backward propagation processes, including weight and bias updates, to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) for a given input-output pair.
